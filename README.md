This is my python hangman game for Sensyne Health

The only requirements are:

The possible solutions to the game are “Sensyne Health”, “Machine Learning“, “Clinically driven“ & “Data Engineering“

The above solutions should NOT be in the code in plain-text

The player gets 5 letter guesses before losing the game. 
The game is lost on the 6th bad guess

Every time a player wins the game, they should get 10 points. 
Ask for the player’s name on game start and maintain a scoreboard with top 10 scoring players. 
The scoreboard should show every time a player wins/loses the game.

We should be able to start your game with a single click or command
